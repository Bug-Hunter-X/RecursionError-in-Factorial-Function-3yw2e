This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common error encountered when writing recursive functions. The `factorial.py` file shows the erroneous function that causes a `RecursionError` when a negative number is used as input. The `factorial_solution.py` file illustrates how to correct the code by adding a base case that explicitly handles negative inputs, preventing infinite recursion.
